# Staples Sales
A convenient sales tracking and quoting application for iPhone, tailored for sales associates of Staples Canada. 

## Overview
Staples Sales provides an organized and extremely simple interface to quickly estimate your tech sale. The app will *eliminate* the wasted time combing through Staples pamphlets, by calculating all warranty plans you could possibly attach to any given product. Your sale can be quickly put together in seconds, giving you all the totals and quick details you need to make the sale on the spot. Once finalized, your sales are recorded, sorted and stored with eachother. At any time, you can retrieve the details of any sale you have made. Furthermore, your daily overall and warranty sales are tracked individually, and can be compared side by side to your figures since day one.


## Usage
The app was designed to for iPhone 6/6S and iPhone 6/6S Plus, running at least iOS 9. Further updates may be coming to extend functionality on other Apple Devices.

## About Me
This app was created entirely myself, Joel Rorseth, 19 year old SWE student from University of Windsor, and a tech associate from Staples store 30 in Windsor, Ontario. Creating this app helped me memorize and familiarize myself with all the warranty options Staples has to offer. The project itself is a good way to demonstrate my experience and skill in iOS and mobile application development. The app was designed, coded, and tested completely.
